## i simulated an orbital solar system to scale!

**Project description:** Equipped with some knowledge on physics, I used actual coordinates of the planets and the Sun with the velocity and calculated the gravitational influence subjected to each celestial bodies. The final result gives out accurate orbital periods, semimajor/ semiminor lengths and I can input the output coordinates to get a simulation in VMD! This is what I learnt and used from this project.

### 1. Lots and lots of arrays and matrices

Every planet has its own gravitational force, and a bunch of them would mean
```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
